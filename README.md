# GetCards

Data scientist [Chris Albon](https://chrisalbon.com/) has been posting pictures of his machine learning flash cards [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrisalbon?lang=en). This repo uses a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook to download them for convenient viewing.


## OSX/Linux

To use this repo, you will:

* Install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and required modules
* Create a Twitter app to provide programmatic access to Twitter
* Run the Jupyter notebook
* View the png images it downloads to the repo's `ml-cards` directory.


### Install Jupyter

Run this command to install Jupyter and required modules:

* `pip install -r module_list.txt`

### Create your Twitter app

This repo uses [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to interact with Twitter. To use it, you will create a new Twitter app and insert those credentials into `Get Flashcards.ipnyb`.

1. Log into twitter
1. Browse to [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/)
1. Click the `Create New App` button and define your new app. Here are some example values:
    * **Name**: `Get Flashcards - <your name>`
    * **Description**: `Chris Albon ML Flashcard puller`
    * **Website**: `http://www.not-used.com`
    * **Callback URLs**: `` <= blank
1. Check the **Developer Agreement** and click the `Create your Twitter application` button.
1. In the application details page, Select the "Keys and Access Tokens" tab.
1. Under "Your Access Token", click the `Create my access token` button.

### Insert your credentials

Open `Get Flashcards.ipynb` and locate these two lines:

```
    "auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret) #Fill these in\n",
    "auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)  #Fill these in\n",
```

Replace the `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret` with single-quoted values from your application settings created in the previous step.

See the [tweepy tutorial](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/auth_tutorial.html) for more information, if needed.

### Run the Jupyter notebook

Run the Jupyter notebook from a shell in the repo root directory

* `jupyter notebook Get\ Flashcards.ipynb`

Jupyter will open a browser page, execute the code, placing all ML flashcards in a `ml-cards` local directory.

You can enter `CTRL+C` twice to stop jupyter from the command line.

### View the cards

All cards are stored in a local `ml-cards` directory.
